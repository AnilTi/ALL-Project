Python OOPs Concepts:-

Python is an object-oriented programming language.
You can easily create and use classes and objects in Python.

Major principles of object-oriented programming system are
given below:-

1. Object
2. Class
3. Method
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism
6. Data Abstraction
7. Encapsulation

1. Object:-

Object is an entity that has state and behavior. It may be anything.
It may be physical and logical. For example: computer, chair , table,
car,etc.

2. Class:-

Class can be defined as a collection of similar type of objects.
It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods.
For example: if you have an employee class then it should contain an
attribute and method i.e. an email id, name, age, salary etc.

3. Method:-

Method is a function that is associated with an object. In Python,
method is not unique to class instances. Any object type can have
methods.

4. Inheritance:-

Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming.It specifies
that one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent
object. By using inheritance you can define a new class with a little
or no changes to the existing class. The new class is known as derived
class or child class and from which it inherits the properties is
called base class or parent class.It provides re-usability of the
code.

5. Polymorphism:-

Polymorphism is made by two words "poly" and "morphs". Poly means
many and Morphs means forms, shape. It defines that one task can
be performed in different ways.
For example: You have a class animal and all animals talk.
But they talk differently.

6. Data Abstraction:-

Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only
functionalities. 

7. Encapsulation:-

Encapsulation is also the feature of object-oriented programming.
It is used to restrict access to methods and variables.
In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a
single unit from being modified by accident.
