'''
In Python 3 predefined inbuilt decorators:-

1. @property decorator
2. @classmethod decorator
3. @staticmethod decorator

In Python 3 types of Methods & 2 types of Variables
in inside of class:-

1. Instance Method
2. Class Method
3. Static Method

a. Instance Variable:-
   A variable that is defined inside a method and
   belongs only to the current instance of a class.

b. Class Variable:-
   A variable that is shared by all instances of a class.
   Class variables are defined within a class but outside
   any of the class's methods.

Methodâˆ’ A special kind of function that is defined in a class
        definition.

# static method :- In instance method & class method we have must
# pass 1 parameter self & cls, but in case of static method we have
# no pass any parameter , its work just like normal function, but
# it belongs to the class member. It is defined using @staticmethod
# decorator. How to check age of students using static method:-

# Diff. b/w class method & static method:-

# 1. class method takes cls as first parameter, while static
#    method need no specific parameters.

# 2. static methods knows nothing about the class state, while
#    class methods can access and modify class state.

# 3. @classmethod decorators are used to create class method,
#    @staticmethod decorators are used to create static methods.

# @property decorator - By using it, we can use the class
# function as an attribute.
